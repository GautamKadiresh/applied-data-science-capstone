The results of this project will reveal the top ten favorite cuisines of the city as well as an insight into city’s sub region’s cuisine preferences. 
The project also aims to cluster the neighborhoods by the cuisine of their popular restaurants using kmeans clustering algorithm to divide and classify the neighborhoods accurately.
The project makes use of foursquare API from the foursquare city guide platform to fetch data of the top 20 restaurants of each neighborhood of the city and the cuisine type of those restaurants. An additional dataset is also required to get the list of all neighborhoods of New York and also their geological coordinates.
The project will be useful for people who wish to enter the New York restaurant business to understand the present scenario of this business field and help make the best choices such as the cuisine of the restaurant and the location of the restaurant.
